# Cplusplus-Program
I used project two 5-3 for this assginment

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
According to Project Two (5-3), the project involved collaborating with Airgead Banking, a client of Chada Tech known for community involvement, to develop an interactive program for a local high school. This program aimed to educate students on fiscal responsibility, with an initial focus on investment and compound interest concepts. By creating a C++ application based on the provided functional requirements and adhering to Airgead Banking Standards, the project sought to address the lack of financial literacy among students by providing them with practical knowledge and tools to manage their finances effectively.

# What did you do particularly well?
The banking application I created operated as intended. User input was properly validated, the user interface aligned with the functional requirements, and the output yielded the anticipated results.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could focus on ensuring that I have fulfilled all the requirements outlined in the rubric. I could also definitely work on the structure and consistency of my code. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
In working on savings.cpp, I encountered challenges ensuring that the output aligned with the provided sample output. Additionally, ensuring consistency between the header files and the corresponding implementation in the .cpp file posed difficulties. It involved significant trial and error, but with persistence, I managed to overcome these hurdles. To aid my understanding and progress, I referred back to previous assignments that shared similarities with this project, especially those involving multiple files. Drawing from past experiences provided valuable insights and guidance throughout the development process.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project serves as a valuable reference for future assistance.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The program's maintainability, readability, and adaptability were ensured through various practices. It was modularly designed with separate files for different components, fostering easier navigation and modification. Descriptive naming and in-line comments were employed to enhance readability and provide clarity on code functionality. Consistent formatting was maintained throughout the codebase for improved readability and comprehension.
